                    <h1>Singed</h1>

                    <p class="descricao">Singed is a Zaunite alchemist of unmatched intellect, who has devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge—with no price, even his own sanity, too high to pay. Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="informacoes">
                    <h1>Astronaut Singed</h1>

                    <p class="descricao">
                        No space adventure would be complete without a navigator. When Singed isn't creating special
                        concoctions to keep his team safe, he's steering the crew's ship through the galaxy, masterfully
                        guiding them to wherever his captain's whimsical orders lead them (and collecting any adorable
                        meeps along the way).

                    <p class="descricao">
                        A dastardly villain lurking in the dark corners of New Valoran, the mild-mannered Dr. Peter
                        Singed
                        was transformed by a volatile chemical of his own invention—becoming the superhuman criminal
                        known
                        only as… Singed! Can anyone stop this vile malefactor before it's too late?!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="informacoes">
                    <h1>Beekeeper Singed</h1>

                    <p class="descricao">
                        At first Singed wasn't certain he wanted to be a master beekeeper. But the moment he put on the
                        protective suit, he knew it was destiny. Nowadays he can be found tending his hives, eating
                        honey,
                        or flipping any hapless wanderers that stop to gaze upon his work.

                <div class="informacoes">
                    <h1>Black Scourge Singed</h1>

                    <p class="descricao">
                        The doctor Singed induced many dreams with his mastery of science, and in these dreams the queen
                        would gaze across the whole of creation, unraveling its secrets. But the shadow soon found her,
                        and
                        as she so hungered for its power, Singed turned to the craven arts to speed her corruption.
                    </p>

                <div class="informacoes">
                    <h1>Resistance Singed</h1>

                    <p class="descricao">
                        Though many in the Resistance find Singed unsettling, few can deny his efficacy in pushing back
                        the
                        machine threat. For Singed, the only thing that matters is driving back Viktor's creations,
                        whatever
                        the means.

                    <h1>Surfer Singed</h1>

                    <p class="descricao">
                        Sure, the haircut is dated, and the off-brand sunscreen is a little dodgy, but Singed held out
                        on
                        the Tiki mug—and look what came roaring back into fashion! The man is a visionary.
